## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![Screenshot](./images/Screenshot.jpg)
Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox





### What I learned

The position element together with its property of CSS of Absolute. Eelemnts that are relatively positioned remain in the normal flow. Another property that I used to confuse it with Absolute was "Fixed" property. This is normaly used when creating gloating elements. The "Sticky" property of position, can be thought of a hybrid of "Fixed" and "Relative"


### Continued development

CSS Grid is one of the other concepts of the css that i need to get myself familiar with. I think It have used quiet often, hence I want to learn and make the most out of it.
 

 ### Useful resources

 
 [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-flexbox-properties) - This site gave me an opportunity to dwell deep into the concepts of how to use the flexbox properties.
I really enjoyed the graphical explanations with detailed diagram and code snippets, that was cherry on-top.

- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) - MDN is my go-to site that I most frequent when building a project, it provides a well laid-out and detailed explanations.
